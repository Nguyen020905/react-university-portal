# 🎓 University Landing Page

A responsive university-themed landing page built with ReactJS.

This project helped me learn more about React fundamentals including component structure, props, and state management. I implemented smooth scrolling when clicking navbar links, conditional rendering for video pop-ups, and a clean, user-friendly UI/UX design. It’s also fully responsive across devices using CSS Flexbox and media queries.
